Feature: search for movies by director
  
  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and serach on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # /home/ubuntu/rag/submissions/361cda673fe6c2dba33e2357c9b6a130/assignment4/2017-07-18-06-49-01/required_features/director.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist: # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:3
      | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
      | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas | 1977-05-25   |
      | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott | 1982-06-25   |
      | Alien        | R      |              | 1979-05-25   |
      | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas | 1971-03-11   |

  Scenario: add director to existing movie                # /home/ubuntu/rag/submissions/361cda673fe6c2dba33e2357c9b6a130/assignment4/2017-07-18-06-49-01/required_features/director.feature:16
    When I go to the edit page for "Alien"                # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48
    And I fill in "Director" with "Ridley Scott"          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:60
    And I press "Update Movie Info"                       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
    Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott" # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:21

  Scenario: find movie with same director                       # /home/ubuntu/rag/submissions/361cda673fe6c2dba33e2357c9b6a130/assignment4/2017-07-18-06-49-01/required_features/director.feature:22
    Given I am on the details page for "Star Wars"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should be on the Similar Movies page for "Star Wars" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:230
    And I should see "THX-1138"                                 # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
    But I should not see "Blade Runner"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:123

  Scenario: can't find similar movies if we don't know director (sad path)   # /home/ubuntu/rag/submissions/361cda673fe6c2dba33e2357c9b6a130/assignment4/2017-07-18-06-49-01/required_features/director.feature:29

    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"                           # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    Then I should either be on the home page or the RottenPotatoes home page # features/step_definitions/saas_web_steps.rb:1
      Can't find mapping from "the RottenPotatoes home page" to a path.
      Now, go and add a mapping in /home/ubuntu/rag/submissions/361cda673fe6c2dba33e2357c9b6a130/assignment4/2017-07-18-06-49-01/features/support/paths.rb (RuntimeError)
